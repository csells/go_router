# Named Routes

When you're navigating to a route with a location, you're hardcoding the URI
construction into your app, e.g.

```dart
void _tap(BuildContext context, String fid, String pid) =>
  context.go('/family/$fid/person/$pid');
```

Not only is that error-prone, but the actual URI format of your app could change
over time. Certainly redirection helps keep old URI formats working, but do you
really want various versions of your location URIs lying  around willy-nilly in
your code? 

## Navigating to Named Routes

The idea of named routes is to make it easy to navigate to a route w/o knowing
or caring what the URI format is. You can add a unique name to your route using
the `GoRoute.name` parameter:

```dart
final _router = GoRouter(
  routes: [
    GoRoute(
      name: 'home',
      path: '/',
      builder: ...,
      routes: [
        GoRoute(
          name: 'family',
          path: 'family/:fid',
          builder: ...,
          routes: [
            GoRoute(
              name: 'person',
              path: 'person/:pid',
              builder: ...,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ],
    ),
    GoRoute(
      name: 'login',
      path: '/login',
      builder: ...,
    ),
  ],
```

You don't need to name any of your routes but the ones that you do name, you can
navigate to using the name and whatever params are needed:

```dart
void _tap(BuildContext context, String fid, String pid) =>
  context.go(context.namedLocation('person', params: {'fid': fid, 'pid': pid}));
```

The `namedLocation` method will look up the route by name in a case-insensitive
way, construct the URI for you and fill in the params as appropriate. If you
miss a param or pass in params that aren't part of the path, you'll get an
error. Since it's somewhat inconvenient to have to dereference the `context`
object twice, go_router provides a `goNamed` method that does the lookup and
navigation in one step:

```dart
void _tap(BuildContext context, String fid, String pid) =>
  context.goNamed('person', params: {'fid': fid, 'pid': pid});
```

There is also a `pushNamed` method that will look up the route by name, pull the
top page off of the generated match stack and push that onto the existing stack
of pages.

## Redirecting to Named Routes

In addition to navigation, you may also want to be able to redirect to a named
route, which you can also do using the `namedLocation` method of either
`GoRouter` or `GoRouterState`:

```dart
// redirect to the login page if the user is not logged in
redirect: (state) {
  final loggedIn = loginInfo.loggedIn;

  // check just the subloc in case there are query parameters
  final loginLoc = state.namedLocation('login');
  final goingToLogin = state.subloc == loginLoc;

  // the user is not logged in and not headed to /login, they need to login
  if (!loggedIn && !goingToLogin)
    return state.namedLocation('login', queryParams: {'from': state.subloc});

  // the user is logged in and headed to /login, no need to login again
  if (loggedIn && goingToLogin) return state.namedLocation('home');

  // no need to redirect at all
  return null;
},
```

In this example, we're using `namedLocation` to get the location for the named
'login' route and then comparing it to the current `subloc` to find out if the
user is currently logging in or not. Furthermore, when we construct a location
for redirection, we use `namedLocation` to pass in parameters to construct the
location. All of this is done without hardcoding any URI formatting into your
code.
