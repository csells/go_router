# Web History

Sometimes you don't want the browser tracking history when you navigate. In that case, go_router supports [Router.neglect](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Router/neglect.html).


```dart

  ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () {
      Router.neglect(context,() {
        context.go('/page2');
      });
    },
    child: const Text('Go to page 2'),
    ),

```


If you'd like the browser to stop tracking history altogether for your app, set routerNeglect to true.  This
will suppress history for all navigation made using go_router.



```dart

  final _router = GoRouter(
    routerNeglect: true,
    routes: [
      GoRoute(
        path: '/',
        builder: (context, state) => const Page1Screen(),
      ),
      GoRoute(
        path: '/page2',
        builder: (context, state) => const Page2Screen(),
      ),
    ],
  );

```
