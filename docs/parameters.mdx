# Parameters

Route paths are defined and implemented in [the path_to_regexp
package](https://pub.dev/packages/path_to_regexp), which gives you the ability
to include parameters in your route's `path`: 

```dart
final _router = GoRouter(
  routes: [
    GoRoute(
      path: '/family/:fid',
      builder: (context, state) {
        // use state.params to get router parameter values
        final family = Families.family(state.params['fid']!);
        return FamilyScreen(family: family);
      },
    ),
  ],
]);
```

You can access the matched parameters in the `state` object using the `params`
property.

## Dynamic Linking

The idea of "dynamic linking" is that as the user adds objects to your app, each
of them gets a link of their own, e.g. a new family gets a new link. This is
exactly what route parameters enables, e.g. a new family has its own identifier
when can be a variable in your family route, e.g. path: `/family/:fid`.

## Query Parameters

Including parameters in the `path` is one way to pass information to the page. A
"path" parameter is required and inline with the location. The other way to pass
data as part of a location is to use query parameters, which is a set of
name-value pairs passed at the end of a URI after a `?` character, e.g.

```dart
void _tap() => context.go('/search?query=kitties');
```

These parameters are optional and, if passed, will be provided in the
`state.queryParams` property for every page matched in a stack of routes:

```dart
GoRoute(
  path: '/search',
  builder: (context, state) {
    // use state.params to get search query from query parameter
    final query = state.queryParams['query']; // may be null
    return SearchPage(query: query);
  },
),
```

Since query parameters are optional, they will be `null` if they're not passed.

## Extra Parameter

In addition to passing along path and query parameters, you can also pass along
an extra object as part of your navigation, e.g.

```dart
void _tap() => context.go('/family', extra: _family);
```

This object is provided as `state.extra`:

```dart
GoRoute(
  path: '/family',
  builder: (context, state) => FamilyScreen(family: state.extra! as Family),
),
```

The `extra` object is useful if you'd like to simply pass along a single object
to the `builder` function w/o passing an object identifier via a URI and looking
up the object from a store. Also, if the user presses the Back button on an
`AppBar`, the `extra` object will be passed along properly.

_However_, the `extra` object cannot be used to create a dynamic link nor can it
be used in deep linking. Furthermore, since a press of the brower's Back button
is treated like a deep link for purposes of navigation, the `extra` object will
be lost when the user navigates back via the browser. For these reasons, __the
use of the `extra` object is not recommended for use in targeting Flutter web
apps__.
