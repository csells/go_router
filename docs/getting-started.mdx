# Getting Started

To use go_router package, [follow these
instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router/install).

If you'd like to see a video overview of go_router package, you can watch the
following:

In this video, I did some pair programming with Majid Hajian to port an existing
Flutter app built using the original Navigation API to use go_router for both
mobile and web.

Note that this video was recorded before the great simplification of go_router
v2.5, so I recommend reading [the docs for migration to v2.5](/migrating-to-25)
after watching the video.
