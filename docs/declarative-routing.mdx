# Declarative Routing

The go_router is governed by a set of routes which you specify as part of the
`GoRouter` constructor:

```dart
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  ...
  final _router = GoRouter(
    routes: [
      GoRoute(
        path: '/',
        pageBuilder: (context, state) => MaterialPage<void>(
          key: state.pageKey,
          child: const Page1Page(),
        ),
      ),
      GoRoute(
        path: '/page2',
        pageBuilder: (context, state) => MaterialPage<void>(
          key: state.pageKey,
          child: const Page2Page(),
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ...
  );
}
```

In this case, we've defined two routes. Each route `path` will be matched
against the location to which the user is navigating. Only a single path will be
matched, specifically the one that matches the entire location (and so it
doesn't matter in which order you list your routes). The `path` will be matched
in a case-insensitive way, although the case for [parameters](/parameters) will
be preserved.

## Router state

A `GoRoute` also contains a `pageBuilder` function which is called to create the
page when a path is matched. The builder function is passed a `state` object,
which is an instance of the `GoRouterState` class that contains some useful
information:

| `GoRouterState` property | description                                        | example 1                | example 2                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `location`               | location of the full route, including query params | `/login?from=/family/f2` | `/family/f2/person/p1`     |
| `subloc`                 | location of this sub-route w/o query params        | `/login`                 | `/family/f2`               |
| `name`                   | the `GoRoute` name                                 | `login`                  | `family`                   |
| `path`                   | the `GoRoute` path                                 | `/login`                 | `family/:fid`              |
| `fullpath`               | full path to this sub-route                        | `/login`                 | `/family/:fid`             |
| `params`                 | params extracted from the location                 | `{}`                     | `{'fid': 'f2'}`            |
| `queryParams`            | optional params from the end of the location       | `{'from': '/family/f1'}` | `{}`                       |
| `extra`                  | optional object param                              | `null`                   | `null`                     |
| `error`                  | `Exception` associated with this sub-route, if any | `Exception('404')`       | ...                        |
| `pageKey`                | unique key for this sub-route                      | `ValueKey('/login')`     | `ValueKey('/family/:fid')` |

You can read more about [sub-locations/sub-routes](/sub-routes) and
[parameterized routes](/parameters) below but the example code above uses the
`pageKey` property as most of the example code does. The `pageKey` is used to
create a unique key for the `MaterialPage` or `CupertinoPage` based on the
current path for that page in the [stack of pages](/sub-routes), so it will
uniquely identify the page w/o having to hardcode a key or come up with one
yourself.

Not all of the state parameters will be set every time. In general, the state is
a superset of the potential current state of a `GoRouter` instance. For example,
the `error` parameter will only be set of there's an error, the `params` won't
be set during top-level redirection because there's no `path` to match yet, etc.

## Error handling

In addition to the list of routes, the go_router needs an `errorPageBuilder`
function in case no page is found, more than one page is found or if any of the
page builder functions throws an exception, e.g.

```dart
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  ...
  final _router = GoRouter(
    ...
    errorPageBuilder: (context, state) => MaterialPage<void>(
      key: state.pageKey,
      child: ErrorPage(state.error),
    ),
  );
}
```

The `GoRouterState` object contains the location that caused the exception and
the `Exception` that was thrown attempting to navigate to that route.

## Initialization

With just a list of routes and an error page builder function, you can create an
instance of a `GoRouter`, which itself provides the objects you need to call the
`MaterialApp.router` constructor:

```dart
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  App({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => MaterialApp.router(
        routeInformationParser: _router.routeInformationParser,
        routerDelegate: _router.routerDelegate,
      );

  final _router = GoRouter(routes: ..., errorPageBuilder: ...);
}
```

With the router in place, your app can now navigate between pages.

## Deep Linking

Flutter defines "deep linking" as "opening a URL displays that screen in your
app." Anything that's listed as a `GoRoute` can be accessed via deep linking
across Android, iOS and the web. Support works out of the box for the web, of
course, via the address bar, but requires additional configuration for Android
and iOS as described in the [Flutter
docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation/deep-linking).
