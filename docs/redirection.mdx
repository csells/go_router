# Redirection

Sometimes you want your app to redirect to a different location. The go_router
allows you to do this at a top level for each new navigation event or at the
route level for a specific route.

## Top-level redirection

Sometimes you want to guard pages from being accessed when they shouldn't be,
e.g. when the user is not yet logged in. For example, assume you have a class
that tracks the user's login info:

```dart
class LoginInfo extends ChangeNotifier {
  var _userName = '';
  String get userName => _userName;
  bool get loggedIn => _userName.isNotEmpty;

  void login(String userName) {
    _userName = userName;
    notifyListeners();
  }

  void logout() {
    _userName = '';
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

You can use this info in the implementation of a `redirect` function that you
pass as to the `GoRouter` constructor:

```dart
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  final loginInfo = LoginInfo();
  ...
  late final _router = GoRouter(
    routes: [
      GoRoute(
        path: '/',
        pageBuilder: (context, state) => MaterialPage<void>(
          key: state.pageKey,
          child: HomePage(families: Families.data),
        ),
      ),
      ...,
      GoRoute(
        path: '/login',
        pageBuilder: (context, state) => MaterialPage<void>(
          key: state.pageKey,
          child: const LoginPage(),
        ),
      ),
    ],

    errorPageBuilder: ...,

    // redirect to the login page if the user is not logged in
    redirect: (state) {
      final loggedIn = loginInfo.loggedIn;
      final goingToLogin = state.location == '/login';

      // the user is not logged in and not headed to /login, they need to login
      if (!loggedIn && !goingToLogin) return '/login';

      // the user is logged in and headed to /login, no need to login again
      if (loggedIn && goingToLogin) return '/';

      // no need to redirect at all
      return null;
    },
  );
}
```

In this code, if the user is not logged in and not going to the `/login`
path, we redirect to `/login`. Likewise, if the user _is_ logged in but going to
`/login`, we redirect to `/`. If there is no redirect, then we just return
`null`. The `redirect` function will be called again until `null` is returned to
enable [multiple redirects](#multiple-redirections).

To make it easy to access this info wherever it's need in the app, consider
using a state management option like
[provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) to put the login info into the
widget tree:

```dart
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  final loginInfo = LoginInfo();

  // add the login info into the tree as app state that can change over time
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => ChangeNotifierProvider<LoginInfo>.value(
        value: loginInfo,
        child: MaterialApp.router(...),
      );
  ...
}
```

With the login info in the widget tree, you can easily implement your login
page:

```dart
class LoginPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(title: Text(_title(context))),
    body: Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // log a user in, letting all the listeners know
              context.read<LoginInfo>().login('test-user');

              // go home
              context.go('/');
            },
            child: const Text('Login'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

In this case, we've logged the user in and manually redirected them to the home
page. That's because the go_router doesn't know that the app's state has
changed in a way that affects the route. If you'd like to have the app's state
cause go_router to automatically redirect, you can use the `refreshListenable`
argument of the `GoRouter` constructor:

```dart
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  final loginInfo = LoginInfo();
  ...
  late final _router = GoRouter(
    routes: ...,
    errorPageBuilder: ...,
    redirect: ...

    // changes on the listenable will cause the router to refresh it's route
    refreshListenable: loginInfo,
  );
}
```

Since the `loginInfo` is a `ChangeNotifier`, it will notify listeners when it
changes. By passing it to the `GoRouter` constructor, the go_router will
automatically refresh the route when the login info changes. This allows you to
simplify the login logic in your app:

```dart
onPressed: () {
  // log a user in, letting all the listeners know
  context.read<LoginInfo>().login('test-user');

  // router will automatically redirect from /login to / because login info
  //context.go('/');
},
```

The use of the top-level `redirect` and `refreshListenable` together is
recommended because it will handle the routing automatically for you when the
app's data changes.

## Route-level redirection

The top-level redirect handler passed to the `GoRouter` constructor is handy
when you want a single function to be called whenever there's a new navigation
event and to make some decisions based on the app's current state. However, in
the case that you'd like to make a redirection decision for a specific route (or
sub-route), you can do so by passing a `redirect` function to the `GoRoute`
constructor:

```dart
final _router = GoRouter(
  routes: [
    GoRoute(
      path: '/',
      redirect: (_) => '/family/${Families.data[0].id}',
    ),
    GoRoute(
      path: '/family/:fid',
      pageBuilder: ...,
  ],
  errorPageBuilder: ...,
);
```

In this case, when the user navigates to `/`, the `redirect` function will be
called to redirect to the first family's page. Redirection will only occur on
the last sub-route matched, so you can't have to worry about redirecting in the
middle of a location being parsed when you're already on your way to another
page anyway.

## Parameterized redirection

In some cases, a path is parameterized, and you'd like to redirect with those
parameters in mind. You can do that with the `params` argument to the `state`
object passed to the `redirect` function:

```dart
GoRoute(
  path: '/author/:authorId',
  redirect: (state) => '/authors/${state.params['authorId']}',
),
```

## Multiple redirections

It's possible to redirect multiple times w/ a single navigation, e.g. `/ => /foo
=> /bar`. This is handy because it allows you to build up a list of routes over
time and not to worry so much about attempting to trim each of them to their
direct route. Furthermore, it's possible to redirect at the top level and at the
route level in any number of combinations.

If you redirect too many times, that's likely to indicate a bug in your app. By
default, more than 5 redirections will cause an exception. You can change this
by setting the `redirectLimit` argument to the `GoRouter` constructor.

The other trouble you need worry about is getting into a loop, e.g. `/ => /foo
=> /`. If that happens, you'll get an exception.

## Example: Redirection and Query Parameters

Sometimes you're doing [deep linking](/declarative-routing#deep-linking) and
you'd like a user to first login before going to the location that represents
the deep link. In that case, you can use [query
parameters](/parameters#query-parameters) in the redirect function:

```dart
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  final loginInfo = LoginInfo();
  ...
  late final _router = GoRouter(
    routes: ...,
    errorPageBuilder: ...,

    // redirect to the login page if the user is not logged in
    redirect: (state) {
      final loggedIn = loginInfo.loggedIn;

      // check just the subloc in case there are query parameters
      final goingToLogin = state.subloc == '/login';

      // the user is not logged in and not headed to /login, they need to login
      if (!loggedIn && !goingToLogin) return '/login?from=${state.subloc}';

      // the user is logged in and headed to /login, no need to login again
      if (loggedIn && goingToLogin) return '/';

      // no need to redirect at all
      return null;
    },

    // changes on the listenable will cause the router to refresh it's route
    refreshListenable: loginInfo,
  );
}
```

In this example, if the user isn't logged in, they're redirected to `/login`
with a `from` query parameter set to the deep link. The `state` object has the
`location` and the `subloc` to choose from. The `location` includes the query
parameters whereas the `subloc` does not. Since the `/login` route may include
query parameters, it's easiest to use the `subloc` in this case (and using the
raw `location` will cause a stack overflow, an exercise that I'll leave to the
reader).

Now, when the `/login` route is matched, we want to pull the `from` parameter
out of the `state` object to pass along to the `LoginPage`:

```dart
GoRoute(
  path: '/login',
  pageBuilder: (context, state) => MaterialPage<void>(
    key: state.pageKey,
    // pass the original location to the LoginPage (if there is one)
    child: LoginPage(from: state.queryParams['from']),
  ),
),
```

In the `LoginPage`, if the `from` parameter was passed, we use it to go to the
deep link location after a successful login:

```dart
class LoginPage extends StatelessWidget {
  final String? from;
  const LoginPage({this.from, Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(title: Text(_title(context))),
    body: Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              // log a user in, letting all the listeners know
              context.read<LoginInfo>().login('test-user');

              // if there's a deep link, go there
              if (from != null) context.go(from!);
            },
            child: const Text('Login'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

It's still good practice to pass in the `refreshListenable` when manually
redirecting, as we do in this case, to ensure any change to the login info
causes the right routing to happen automatically, e.g. the user logging out will
cause them to be routed back to the login page.
