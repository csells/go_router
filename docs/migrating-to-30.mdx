# Migrating to 3.0

go_router v3.0 comes with two breaking changes:

1. signature of the `navigatorBuilder` function
1. behavior and signature of the `GoRouter.pop` function

## New `navigatorBuilder` function signature

In previous version, the `navigatorBuilder` function was called with a
`BuildContext` and a `Widget?`. You could implement it like so:

```dart
final _router = GoRouter(
  routes: ...,

  // add a wrapper around the navigator to put loginInfo into the widget tree
  navigatorBuilder: (context, child) => ChangeNotifierProvider<LoginInfo>.value(
    value: loginInfo,
    child: child,
    builder: (context, child) => child!,
  ),
);
```

Two problems with this signature were that the `child` parameter was nullable,
even though it would never be `null`. This was done to reuse the
`TransitionBuilder` typedef, but the result was that a `navigatorBuilder`
function implementation would need to need to check for `null`; annoying!

Even worse, if you wanted to drive the `navigatorBuilder` function
implementation with information like the navigation location, it wasn't
available as a parameter; super annoying!

In v3, both of these problems were addressed by changing the signature of
`navigatorBuilder`:

```dart
/// The signature of the navigatorBuilder callback.
typedef GoRouterNavigatorBuilder = Widget Function(
  BuildContext context,
  GoRouterState state,
  Widget child,
);
```

This allows an implementation to use the location, e.g. like this from the
[nested navigation
samples](https://github.com/csells/go_router/blob/main/go_router/example/lib/nested_nav.dart):

```dart
navigatorBuilder: (context, state, child) => Material(
    child: Column(
      children: [
        Expanded(child: child),
        Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
          child: Text(state.location), // now you can use GoRouterState
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ),
```

This implementation shows the current location as the user navigates through the
app, something that was harder to do in previous versions.

## Change to the `GoRouter.pop` function behavior and signature

In previous versions, the `GoRouter.pop` function simply called `Navigator.pop`.
This was somewhat non-intuitive, since, unlike the rest of the `GoRouter`
methods, it required a `BuildContext` parameter:

```dart
// global GoRouter
final _router = GoRouter(...);

...

TextButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    if (await abandonNewPerson(context)) {
      _router.pop(context); // pass the context, please
    }
  },
  child: const Text('Cancel'),
),
```

Some developers prefer to make their `GoRouter` instance global so that they can
call them without the use of a context, which meant they couldn't call `pop`.
This was done as a simple way to implement `GoRouter.pop` by simply forwarding
to `Navigator.pop`, which itself was non-intuitive; go_router has it's own stack
of pages, calling `pop` should just work with those pages, right?

Either way, you can continue to call `Naviator.pop(context)` if that's the
behavior you want. Otherwise, you can use the simpler version of `GoRouter.pop`:

```dart
// global GoRouter
final _router = GoRouter(...);

...

TextButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    if (await abandonNewPerson(context)) {
      _router.pop(); // no context for you!
    }
  },
  child: const Text('Cancel'),
),
```

If you do have context and are using the Dart extension, your code won't need to
change at all:

```dart
TextButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    if (await abandonNewPerson(context)) {
      context.pop(); // no code changes needed in this case
    }
  },
  child: const Text('Cancel'),
),
```
