# Changelog

### 3.1.0-dev

- added `GoRouteData` and `TypedGoRoute` to enable
  [typed routing](https://gorouter.dev/typed-routing).
- require Dart 2.14 (Flutter 2.5) or greater.

### 3.0.0

- breaking change: added `GoRouterState` to `navigatorBuilder` function
- breaking change: removed `BuildContext` from `GoRouter.pop()` to remove the
  need to use `context` parameter when calling the `GoRouter` API; this changes
  the behavior of `GoRouter.pop()` to only pop what's on the `GoRouter` page
  stack and no longer calls `Navigator.pop()`
- new [Migrating to 3.0 section](https://gorouter.dev/migrating-to-30) in the
  docs to describe the details of the breaking changes and how to update your
  code

### 2.5.7

- [PR 262](https://github.com/csells/go_router/pull/262): add support for
  `Router.neglect`; thanks to [nullrocket](https://github.com/nullrocket)!
- [PR 265](https://github.com/csells/go_router/pull/265): add Japanese
  translation of the docs; thanks to
  [toshi-kuji](https://github.com/toshi-kuji)! Unfortunately I don't yet know
  how to properly display them via docs.page, but [I'm working on
  it](https://github.com/csells/go_router/issues/266)
- updated the examples using the `from` query parameter to be completely
  self-contained in the `redirect` function, simplifying usage
- updated the async data example to be simpler
- added a new example to show how to implement a loading page
- renamed the navigator_integration example to user_input and added an example
  of `WillPopScope` for go_router apps

### 2.5.6

- [PR 259](https://github.com/csells/go_router/pull/259): remove a hack for
  notifying the router of a route change that was no longer needed; thanks to
  [nullrocket](https://github.com/nullrocket)!
- improved async example to handle the case that the data has been returned but
  the page is no longer there by checking the `mounted` property of the screen

### 2.5.5

- updated implementation to use logging package for debug diagnostics; thanks
  to [johnpryan](https://github.com/johnpryan)

### 2.5.4

- fixed up the `GoRouterRefreshStream` implementation with an export, an example
  and some docs

### 2.5.3

- added `GoRouterRefreshStream` from
  [jopmiddelkamp](https://github.com/jopmiddelkamp) to easily map from a
  `Stream` to a `Listenable` for use with `refreshListenable`; very useful when
  combined with stream-based state management like
  [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)
- dartdocs fixups from [mehade369](https://github.com/mehade369)
- example link fixes from [ben-milanko](https://github.com/ben-milanko)

  `MaterialPage`, etc.

  failed assertion in Flutter when using `Duration.zero` in the
  `NoTransitionPage`

### 2.5.0

- provide default implementation of `GoRoute.pageBuilder` to provide a simpler
  way to build pages via the `GoRouter.build` method
- provide default implementation of `GoRouter.errorPageBuilder` to provide a
  simpler way to build error pages via the `GoRouter.errorBuilder` method
- provide default implementation of `GoRouter.errorBuilder` to provide an error
  page without the need to implement a custom error page builder
- new [Migrating to 2.5 section](https://gorouter.dev/migrating-to-25) in
  the docs to show how to take advantage of the new `builder` and default error
  page builder
- removed `launch.json` as VSCode-centric and unnecessary for discovery or easy
  launching
- added a [new custom error screen
  sample](https://github.com/csells/go_router/blob/master/example/lib/error_screen.dart)

  sample](https://github.com/csells/go_router/blob/master/example/lib/widgets_app.dart)
